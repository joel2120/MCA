# Program to compare Sequential and Parallel performances of KMP Algorithm by using MPI

# Sequential Vs Parallel Time Comparison graph:

The above graph shows us the comparison of sequential and parallel time in which we have taken the input file in KB on X-axis and Time(s) to compute in Y-axis by keeping the pattern file constant. So the above graph shows that the parallel computation time is more efficient than the sequential time and the performance of parallel is completely outplayed the sequential performance.

# Scalability graph:

The above shows us the number of processes on X-axis and the time taken by that process on Y-axis. In the above graph 10 processes are taken and computed the time taken by them in seconds. It shows that if we go on increasing the number of processes, then the performance gets better. In this way the scalability is achieved.
